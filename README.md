# Exploratory_data_analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL is all about digging into the data using queries to see what’s really going on. It helps me understand the dataset, find interesting patterns, and spot anything unusual. While exploring, I usually clean up the data too fixing missing values or inconsistencies so it’s ready for deeper analysis later on.

I'll be working with the cleaned data from [data_cleaning_with_sql](https://github.com/Hayat-Halabi/data_cleaning_with_sql/tree/main) project to perform further exploration and analysis.
